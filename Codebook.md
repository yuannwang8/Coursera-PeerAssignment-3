The data comprises sensor signals from experiences conducted with a group of 30 volunteers, each performing six activities ((WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)).

Details of experiment can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Sensor signals are taken along the three axis (x, y, and z).

Data from the three axis & angular data are not merged into a directional vector as vectorial physics is outside the scope of this exercise.

The data is taken as is from the downloaded file.  No further data cleansing was performed on the dataset.
